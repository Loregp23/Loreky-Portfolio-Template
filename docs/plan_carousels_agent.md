# Prompt/Question to the AI Agent

How do I create a Projects section with multiple carousels, each with its own title, subtitle, and independent navigation, styled to match the rest of my portfolio?

# AI Agent’s Complete Plan Response

1. Add three carousels to the Projects section: Illustration, Comic, Editorial Illustration.
2. Give each carousel a unique title and subtitle above it.
3. Add left/right navigation arrows and indicator dots for each carousel.
4. Remove all project tag elements from carousel cards.
5. Style carousels and their titles/subtitles to match About/Skills sections, including light mode support.
6. Remove all box-shadows from carousel cards for a flat look.
7. Make carousels fully responsive and visually consistent.
8. Implement independent carousel logic in JavaScript for each section, with smooth transitions and touch/swipe support.
9. Test all carousels for theme consistency, responsiveness, and accessibility.
